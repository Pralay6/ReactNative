## Code Overview

### `App.js`

This is the main component of the app. It uses `FlatList` to render a list of users. The `users` array contains user data, and each item in the list is rendered using the `GetUser` component.

### `components/GetUser.jsx`

The `GetUser` component is responsible for displaying individual user information. It receives `item` as a prop and should render the user's name and email.

## Example

Hereâ€™s what a single user might look like when rendered:

```
Name: Pralay
Email: pralay@gmail.com
```
